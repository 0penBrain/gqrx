Simple AM, FM and SSB software receiver implemented using GNU Radio and Qt GUI
toolkit.

To run this application you need to have GNU Radio 3.3 with gr-qtgui component
installed, as well as a USRP1. Of course, it can be modified to use USRP2.

Currently only AM demodulator has been implemented. This is a very rough
functional prototype that will evolve into a fully functional radio-scanner type
application with recording, playback, etc. so stay tuned.
