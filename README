Gqrx is an experimental AM, FM and SSB software defined receiver implemented using
GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit.

Currently it works on Linux and can use the Funcube Dongle as input source.

Dependencies:
  - gnuradio-core 3.4.0-101 or later
  - gnuradio-audio 3.4.0-101 or later
  - gr-fcd (https://github.com/csete/gr-fcd)
  - Qt 4.7 (available in all recent Linux)

The build system is based on qmake and to build gqrx simply load the gqrx.pro file
into Qt Creator and click build (the hammer icon).

If the GNU Radio libraries have been installed into a non-standard location, e.g.
/opt/gnuradio, Qt Creator may not be able to pick up the headers and libraries.
Assuming that your PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set up correctly, you can work around this
by launching Qt Creator from the terminal.

First time you start gqrx it will ask you to specify th einput and output device.
For the input device you can check /proc/asound/cards to see what number the
Funcube Dongle has. For example:

 0 [Intel          ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel
                      HDA Intel at 0xf0120000 irq 49
 1 [HDMI           ]: HDA-Intel - HDA ATI HDMI
                      HDA ATI HDMI at 0xf0210000 irq 50
 2 [default        ]: USB-Audio - FUNcube Dongle V1.0
                      Hanlincrest Ltd.          FUNcube Dongle V1.0   at usb-0000:00:1d.0-1.7

means that you can use hw:2 as input device.

Technically, gqrx can use any soundcard as input device but the sample rate is fixed
at 96 kHz (bug).
